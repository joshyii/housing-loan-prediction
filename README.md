# Housing Loan Approval Prediction

This is a group project for a Data Mining assignment that is led by me. It includes data understanding, data description, data preprocessing, data visualization, and model building which answers 4 research questions.

The 4 research questions are:

1. Given gender, marital status, number of dependents, education status, property area, presence of credit history, coapplicant income, loan amount and loan amount term, how accurately can we predict the outcome of loan status?
2. How does k-fold cross validation affect the performance and prediction accuracy of models?
3. Relating to social injustice issues, do gender, marital status and education play a part in affecting the outcome of loan status?
4. Which attributes relate strongly to the outcome of loan status?

The research questions are answered by building 3 models: Decision tree, Naive Bayes classifier and neural network

I am mostly in charge of framing the research questions, performing data preprocessing and developing decision tree and naive bayes clasifier
